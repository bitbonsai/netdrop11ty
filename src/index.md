# TL;DR

1. Place content (`.md`, `.jpg` files, whatever) on a Dropbox folder
2. This will trigger a `Netlify build`
3. Your 11ty site will be updated!

# Background

This is an experiment on how to build the **simplest possible CMS** (content management system).

The main idea is: you drop few `.md` files in a Dropbox folders, together with some images, and boom! Site updated.

**Disclaimer**: this started as a fork of [netlibox](https://github.com/jimniels/netlibox) from [Jim Niels](https://github.com/jimniels), but I wrote it from scratch to learn what I was doing, and to add 2 features:

1. The ability to use images as well (netlibox is meant for markdown only)
2. To use [11ty](https://11ty.dev) instead of Jekyll. I found netlibox and very useful tips on [Netlify's blog](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/10/15/combining-netlify-with-dropbox-for-a-one-click-publishing-process/), without it this wouldn't be possible. Thanks a lot, mate!

My first idea was to build a Notion backed CMS, but at this point there's no support for images. Any alternative I could think of, to store images, would require at least 2 services, one for content, another for images or binary content.

I'm perfectly fine with git. But what about people who are not, and would like an easy way to update a website content?

Writing Markdown might not be super easy for some, but there are tools to help, like [Typora](https://typora.io/).

This project is part of [freecommerce.com.au](https://freecommerce.com.au), an initiative to help Australian small business to have an online e-commerce presence for free.

# 5 steps instructions to success

## Requirements

You'll need to have 3 free accounts on:

- Dropbox
- Netlify
- Github (or Gitlab, Bitbucket)

### 1. Clone this repo to your account on github (or other provider)

You don't need to be a git expert to do this. You can use the `fork` button on github's UI, or use a free visual tool like [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Atlassian Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

Cloning is just copying these source files to a place where you can edit them. Using those desktop apps will put them in your computer for local acess, `forking` will create a copy you can edit online on github using the browser.

![Fork button on github](/img/fork.png)

### 2. Create Dropbox App to hold your content

Log in into your Dropbox account in the browser, and go to the [My apps page](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps). There you can create an App, which is a special folder that your site will be able to access and get content from.

![Create app at Dropbox](/img/create-app.png)

Make sure to select `Scoped Access` and `App folder`, so your site will only have access to this App's folder, not your entire account. Choose a fancy name and go configure your app!
![Crete app - step 1](/img/create1.png)

Your app will be created. Now check the settings and make sure that `Permission type` is scoped, check the `App folder name`, and change `Access token expiration` to `No expiration` if you like.

Click on `Generate access token` and copy that value, you'll need it later.

You can see in the screenshot the `Webhook URIs` filled in, but no worries, we'll do it later.

#### Important: set the right permissions

This got me a couple times. You'll get `400` errors if you forget this. Go to the permissions tab and check `Files and folders` permissions. You need to make sure `files.metadata.read` and `files.content.read` are checked. Save and for now, we're done in Dropbox.

### 3. Create a new Netlify site from your github repo

On Netlify, create a new site from git. Follow the authorization prompts, find your repo, connect it to Netlify.

![Connect to a git provider](/img/netlify1.png)

![Pick a repo](/img/netlify2.png)

![Site settings and deploy](/img/netlify3.png)

#### 3.1 Netlify site settings

There are a couple steps to do here.

Go to the `Site Settings` option (top right) and let's start.

![Site settings](/img/netlify4.png)

First one is to customise the `Site name` to something that makes more sense to you. This will be used in the url and is unique to the whole Netlify. In the example here, I chose `netdrop11ty.netlify.app`

Next, create a `Build hook`. Just click the button `Add` and accept defaults. Give it the following name: `NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK_URL`

Then, go to `Build & Deploy` → `Environment variables`. You'll create 3 `ENV` variables:

<div class="dbx-contents pre">CONTENT_DIR: ./src/dbx
DBX_ACCESS_TOKEN: [YOUR DROPBOX TOKEN]
NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK_URL: [THE GENERATED BUILD HOOK IN THE STEP ABOVE]
</div>

#### 3.2 Netlify functions

Dropbox has a particularity that we need to deal through Netlify's functions; the first request you do to dbx api, it responds with a challenge query string parameter, and demands that you send the same parameter back. After that you can actually request the files.

To work with that, we need a [Netlify function](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/?_ga=2.144098101.108854660.1628386823-1325281063.1626650890), which is going to be executed on every build, before we request the actual folder contents to dropbox. So here's what happens when you `build`:

1. Netlify function sends an API request to Dropbox → `dbx-webhook.js`
2. Dropbox answers with a challenge param
3. Netlify function responds back with challenge parameter. We're clear with DBX
4. Netlify runs `npm run build` from our `package.json`, which triggers `get-content-from-dbx.js` first
5. With the DBX content, 11ty builds the site with updated content and puts in `_site`. Netlify deployment is **done**

I got the [function](https://github.com/jimniels/netlibox/blob/master/src/_netlify-functions/dropbox-webhook.js) from netlibox repo, thanks once more, [Jim](https://github.com/jimniels)!

It's possible to test this function locally, if you install `netlify-lambda`. I haven't because it has some security issues, and installs webpack; I preferred not to. If you do, please check [netlibox](https://github.com/jimniels/netlibox/) which does.

![Functions menu](/img/netlify5.png)

Go to the functions menu, and change its `Function Directory` settings to `src/_netlify-function`.

In the next deploy this will create a function for you, that you'll need next. Load the [functions](https://app.netlify.com/sites/netdrop11ty/functions) page and you should now see:

![dbx-webhook function](/img/netlify7.png)

Clicking on it will give you access to the function URL, that we need. It's easy to infer as well. In my case is `https://netdrop11ty.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/dbx-webhook`

### 4. Netlify functions into Dropbox

Remember the [Dropbox App console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)? Let's go back there and finish the configuration.

Scroll the page until you find `Webhooks URI`, and add the one you just copied above.

![Webhooks at Dropbox App console](/img/webhooks-dbx.png). If all goes well, you should see an `Enabled` status. If not, delete it, go back to Netlify to get the right URL and add it.

If you forgot to add the right permissions in Dropbox and start to get a 400, add the permission, generate an new access token and put it into Netlify UI.

### 5. Last step: `.env` file

Now you already have all the elements. Just rename the local `.env.example` file to `.env` (it's inside .gitignore, so your tokens are not shared) and fill `DBX_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK_URL` as you've done in Netlify's UI.

And now? `Deploy`!
